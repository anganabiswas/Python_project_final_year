Image Classification using CNN and Explainable AI(XAI)

***Project Overview: Image Classification using CNN and Explainable AI***
This project focuses on developing image classification models utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze two distinct datasets: bone fractures and flower images. The goal is to create accurate models for identifying and classifying images, while also incorporating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide insights into model predictions.

**Datasets**
 - Bone Fracture Dataset: This dataset consists of X-ray images used to classify different types of bone fractures. The model aims to assist in medical diagnosis by providing reliable predictions on fracture types.
 - Flower Image Dataset: This dataset includes a variety of flower species, allowing the model to classify images based on distinct floral characteristics. The classification aims to enhance botanical research and flower recognition applications.

**Objectives**
 - Develop a robust CNN model for image classification
 - Implement XAI techniques to elucidate the decision-making process of the model.
 - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Technologies Used**
 - Python
 - Colab
 - Keras
 - Matplotlib for data visualization
 - LIME for Explainable AI
